## Supported Rust Versions

<!--
When updating this, also update:
- .clippy.toml
- Cargo.toml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
-->

Alloy will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported rust version) policy of **at
least** 6 months. When increasing the MSRV, the new Rust version must have been
released at least six months ago. The current MSRV is 1.64.0.

Note that the MSRV is not increased automatically, and only as part of a minor
release.

## Provenance note

These crates was originally part of the [reth] project, as [`reth_rlp`] and [`reth_rlp_derive`].

`reth_rlp` was forked from an earlier Apache-licensed version of the [`fastrlp`]
crate, before it changed licence to GPL. The Rust `fastrlp` implementation is
itself a port of the [Golang Apache-licensed fastrlp][gofastrlp].
